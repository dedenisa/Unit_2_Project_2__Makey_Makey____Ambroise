# Unit_2_Project_2__Makey_Makey____Ambroise
Makey Makey Game

<h2> Project Description: </h2>
<p> This project is a tapping game. In this game, all you have to do is tap 1 shape out of 11 and when you tap teh shape, a sentence is 
being said.There are 6 positive phrases and 5 negative phrases. To make the audio, work, you need to have your index in the ground level
of the makey makey and you need to touch the alluminium that is on the shapes with your other hand.</p>

<h2> Inspiration: </h2>
<p> My inspiration of my prject, is the arcade game where you have to punch the punching ball and the machine gives you a score. But I
wanted to change my game a little bit, instead of having a score, you would have sentences that would come out and say soemthing.</p>
